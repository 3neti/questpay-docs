# Strategic Context: The Big Switch

---

## Overview

**The Big Switch** is Maya's strategic transformation from being a **destination wallet** to becoming the **origin of digital value** in the Philippines.

> **"Maya becomes the source, not just the sink."**

QuestPay™ is a key driver of this strategy, creating **redemption velocity** and **voucher adoption** through competitive, entertainment-driven gameplay.

---

## From Wallet to World

### The Current Landscape

Traditional digital wallets (like GCash) function as **closed ecosystems**:
- Users store and spend within the same wallet
- Transfers require both parties to have the same app
- Wallets compete for merchant acceptance and user retention

### The Big Switch Vision

Maya transforms into an **open voucher issuance platform**:
- Users **generate** digital vouchers that anyone can redeem
- Transfers become **voucher-to-anyone** — open and universal
- Maya captures **the first mile** of every money movement
- Focus shifts from retention to **origination**

> **Maya doesn't need to control every redemption endpoint — it only needs to issue the voucher.**

---

## How QuestPay™ Drives The Big Switch

### 1. Redemption Velocity Engine

QuestPay creates **high-frequency redemption events** through:
- Competitive challenges requiring rapid voucher redemptions
- Time-based gameplay driving urgency
- Multi-location quests increasing redemption touchpoints
- Public visibility normalizing voucher usage

**Impact**: Every episode generates hundreds to thousands of redemption events, showcasing Maya vouchers as **liquid, portable value**.

### 2. Open Redemption Demonstration

QuestPay proves that redemptions work **everywhere**:
- Contestants redeem at diverse merchant types
- Cross-wallet compatibility demonstrated live
- No app barriers — redemption is universal
- Public witnesses frictionless value transfer

**Impact**: Builds consumer confidence that **Maya vouchers = accepted everywhere**.

### 3. Cultural Shift from Payment to Redemption

QuestPay reframes digital transactions through *"Redeem. Race. Repeat."*

The game transforms vouchers into:
- **Redemption events** (not just payments)
- **Value unlocking** (not just spending)
- **Proof of action** (not just purchase confirmation)

**Impact**: Shifts public perception to see vouchers as **the new form of money**.

## Strategic Positioning

### Current Behavior vs. Big Switch Behavior

| Traditional Wallet Model | The Big Switch Model |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Users store and spend within wallet | Users **create** and **send** vouchers from Maya |
| Transfers are wallet-to-wallet | Transfers are **voucher-to-anyone** |
| Wallet is destination of funds | Maya is **origin and proof of issuance** |
| Focus on utility (bills, top-up) | Focus on empowerment (generate, gift, reward) |

> With **The Big Switch**, people use Maya even if redemption happens elsewhere — because **Maya controls the start** of the transaction.

## Competitive Advantage for Maya

### Market Share Strategy

| Dimension | GCash (Current) | Maya (After Big Switch) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Function** | Wallet for storing and paying | **Platform for creating and sending value** |
| **Growth Mode** | Add more merchants | Add more **voucher issuers** |
| **Barrier** | Merchant QR adoption | **Network effect of voucher creation** |
| **Revenue Model** | MDR, interest spread | **Voucher generation + redemption velocity** |
| **Brand Message** | "Pay with GCash." | **"Redeem with Maya."** |

### QuestPay's Role

QuestPay accelerates this positioning by:
- Making voucher generation **entertaining and visible**
- Creating **redemption heroes** (contestants as voucher power users)
- Building **aspirational narratives** around voucher usage
- Generating **data** on redemption patterns and merchant readiness
- Demonstrating **B2B applications** (brand vouchers, rewards, incentives)

---

## Technical Enablement: x-Change

The underlying infrastructure is powered by **x-Change voucher technology**:

1. **Voucher Generation API** within Maya app
2. **Cryptographically signed codes** with metadata (amount, expiry, sender)
3. **Open Redemption Rail** — redeemable via partner wallets, QR PH, or web portal
4. **Instant Settlement** to Maya's trust account
5. **Audit Trail & Analytics Dashboard** for transparency

### Outcome
Maya doesn't need to own redemption endpoints — it only needs to **issue** the voucher. That issuance defines Maya as the **origin brand of digital value.**

---

## Business Impact

### User Acquisition
- Non-Maya users open Maya to **generate or receive vouchers**
- QuestPay contestants become Maya brand ambassadors
- Viewers see Maya vouchers as the **standard for digital value**

### Engagement Velocity
- Each voucher triggers at least **two active users** (sender + receiver)
- QuestPay challenges create **multiple redemption cycles** per episode
- Social sharing amplifies voucher visibility

### Float Retention
- Unredeemed or delayed vouchers temporarily increase Maya's float
- Challenge mechanics can strategically time redemption windows

### Data Ownership
- Maya gains visibility into **intent-to-pay events**, not just completed payments
- QuestPay provides rich behavioral data on voucher usage patterns

### Brand Visibility
- Every voucher visually states **"Issued by Maya"**
- QuestPay makes Maya synonymous with **redemption-based gameplay**

> Even if GCash remains a redemption endpoint, **Maya owns the narrative and origin of value.**

## Revenue Model Alignment

| Revenue Source | Description | QuestPay Contribution |

| **Voucher Creation** | Users/brands pay per voucher generated | QuestPay drives demand for branded vouchers |
