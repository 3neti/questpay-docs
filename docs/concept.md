# Game Concept: Premise & Themes

---

## Game Premise

QuestPay™ contestants (individuals or teams) embark on a multi-stage adventure where progression requires completing verified digital payment transactions.

### The Core Loop

1. **Receive a QuestPay voucher code** triggered by an action (completing previous challenge, registration, CTA click, etc.) and delivered via SMS or email with optional QR representation
2. **Complete the mission** involving a real-world transaction or task
3. **Redeem the voucher** which triggers x-Change's rich redemption flow:
   - Splash page displays challenge message and instructions
   - **Redemption wizard collects required inputs and proof** (text responses, receipt photos, location check-ins, signatures, KYC data, survey responses)
   - Contestant must complete all required inputs to redeem successfully
   - Upon successful redemption, contestant redirected to interactive landing page
4. **Game operator receives real-time feedback** via webhook with:
   - Redemption status and collected data
   - Automatic verification via x-Change webhooks and API validation
   - Completion status
5. **Landing page presents interactive challenge elements:**
   - Challenge details and mission objectives
   - **Sponsor activations**: Download mobile app, register for service, watch video/ad
   - **Interactive tasks**: Solve puzzles, complete captcha, answer trivia
   - **Educational content**: Tutorial videos, product demos, brand storytelling
   - Links to merchants, locations, or partner platforms
   - **Next voucher code revealed** after verification is complete
6. **Progress toward final quest** and grand prize (return to step 1 with new voucher)

### What Makes It Work

- **Real transactions** = Real verification (no faking it)
- **Digital trail** = Transparent, auditable gameplay
- **Partner integration** = Merchants and services become game locations
- **Scalable difficulty** = From simple purchases to complex multi-step missions
- **Viewer participation** = Audience can follow along and predict outcomes
