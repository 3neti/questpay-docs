# Strategic Partnerships

## Overview

QuestPay™ creates transformative value for technology partners, particularly digital wallet providers. By integrating x-Change's voucher technology, partners evolve from traditional payment processors into **value orchestrators** powering the redemption economy.

### The Core Shift

> **"From payments to participation."**

| Traditional Wallet Model | Voucher Economy Model |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Money-in / Money-out | Value-in / Redemption-out |
| Earns from float, fees, merchant MDR | Earns from voucher creation, redemption velocity, and brand activations |
| Utility-driven | Emotion-driven (engagement, gifting, gamification) |
| Transactional | Social, participatory, and narrative-based |

---

## The Redemption Economy

### Consumer Shift

- 70M+ wallet users in the Philippines are seeking more *meaningful digital experiences*
- Gen Z and Millennials treat digital value as **tokens of participation**, not just money
- They crave *shareable, redeemable, and gamified* interactions

### Platform Gap

- Existing wallets focus on bill payments and cash-ins — transactional, not emotional
- There's no wallet that owns the **culture of redemption** yet
- QuestPay™ + partner wallet can establish the **first Redemption Economy Platform**

## Understanding Partner Economics

### How Digital Wallets Earn Today

Most digital wallets rely on traditional revenue sources:

| Revenue Source | Description | Limitations |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **🪙 Float Income** | Interest earned from user balances held in trust accounts | **BSP-regulated and capped** |
| **💳 Merchant Discount Rates (MDR)** | 1–2% per merchant transaction | Shared with partners; volume-dependent |
| **🏦 Cash-In / Cash-Out Fees** | Small fees for loading/withdrawing (e.g., ₱15–₱30) | Transaction-dependent |
| **📱 Bill Payment & Marketplace Fees** | Partner integration fees | Stable but low-margin |
| **💼 Lending & Credit** | Income from credit products | High-margin but risk-heavy and regulated |
| **🎁 Brand Sponsorships** | Paid campaigns and cashback partnerships | Seasonal, ad-budget dependent |
| **📊 Data & Insights** | Aggregated analytics for partners | Secondary stream under privacy constraints |

### The Limitation of Float-Based Models

1. **Float is capped** — EMIs cannot freely invest float; it must remain fully backed in trust accounts
2. **Transaction fees depend on volume** — costly to grow in mature markets
3. **Promotions are expensive** — high acquisition cost, low retention
4. **Credit involves regulatory complexity** — risk exposure and compliance burden

> Traditional wallet revenue is reliable, but **finite** — every stream depends on volume, interest rates, or regulatory tolerance.

### The Evolution: Redemption Economy Model

By integrating **x-Change** through **QuestPay™**, partners can expand from *transactional wallets* to *redemption-driven platforms*.

| Traditional Wallet Model | Redemption Economy Model |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Money-in / Money-out | Value-in / Redemption-out |
| Earns from float, MDR, fees | Earns from voucher generation, advanced features, activations |
| Utility-driven | Emotion-driven (gifting, gaming, participation) |
| Transactional | Social and narrative-based |
| Dependent on volume | Scalable through behavior loops |
| **BSP-regulated revenue** | **Non-regulated micro-revenue streams** |

> **x-Change** turns every code, token, or voucher into a micro-transaction that **generates revenue without holding float**.

## Case Study: QuestPay™ x Maya

### Strategic Alignment

**QuestPay™** and **Maya** share a common mission: to accelerate digital adoption and make financial participation fun, inclusive, and rewarding.

Together, they can redefine how Filipinos interact with money — not just as spenders or savers, but as **participants in a redemption-driven ecosystem**.

| Dimension | Maya | QuestPay™ |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Core Competence** | Wallet, EMI license, marketing reach | Redemption infrastructure (x-Change), content IP |
| **Shared Objective** | Drive adoption and inclusion | Create viral, mission-driven engagement |
| **Integration Type** | API + co-brand | Redemption engine and format license |
| **Cultural Alignment** | Youthful, digital, reward-focused | Playful, experiential, inclusive |

### Phase 1: The National Pilot

**Working Title**: *QuestPay™: The Maya Redemption Race*

> "Maya powers the first nationwide redemption race."

**Launch Concept**:
- Co-branded reality experience where users compete through real transactions and voucher redemptions
- Every redemption = verified transaction = measurable engagement
- Maya provides wallet infrastructure and category exclusivity

**Pilot Metrics**:
- 100K+ new wallet sign-ups
- 1M+ redemptions within pilot season
- ₱50M+ in voucher transaction volume
- Nationwide media exposure and digital engagement

**Pilot Scope**:
- 5-episode pilot or 1-week city-wide challenge
- 10–15 contestants, 1K+ viewer participants
- Powered by Maya wallet redemptions
- Real-time dashboards and public leaderboards

### Phase 2: Voucher Economy Expansion

> "Turn redemption into everyday behavior."

Once the format proves scalable, Maya can:

1. **Open voucher generation APIs** to businesses and individuals
2. Let users **generate, send, and redeem codes** as easily as sending money
3. Enable **micro-transfers, community aid, gifting, and merchant promos** — all via x-Change
4. Monetize **voucher creation and redemption events** instead of relying solely on float

### Strategic Context: The Big Switch

This partnership model is part of **The Big Switch** — Maya's strategic transformation from destination wallet to the **origin of digital value**. QuestPay™ accelerates this shift by creating redemption velocity and demonstrating the power of open vouchers.

## New Business Model for Wallet Partners

### Revenue Streams Beyond Traditional Fees

| Revenue Stream | Fee Structure | Growth Driver |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Basic Voucher Generation** | ₱1–₱5 per code creation | Everyday voucher issuance by users, SMEs, NGOs, event organizers |
| **Advanced Voucher Features** | ₱1–₱50 per voucher (shared with x-Change) | Rich redemption flows, landing pages, data collection, conditional logic |
| **Brand Activations** | Campaign-based pricing (₱500k–₱5M+) | Media tie-ins, CSR programs, sponsored challenges |
| **Transaction Velocity** | Indirect revenue from faster engagement | Lower dormancy, higher wallet activity, more transactions |
| **Data & Analytics** | Subscription or usage-based | Redemption insights (opt-in) for merchants and partners |
| **API Licensing** | ₱50k–₱200k setup + usage fees | Third-party integrations for voucher issuance |

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Non-regulated revenue** — Not subject to BSP float restrictions
- **Event-driven income** — Revenue from activity, not deposits
- **Shared value model** — x-Change and partner wallet split advanced feature fees
- **Scalable with behavior** — More engagement = more revenue, without regulatory caps

> **Partners no longer earn from "holding money" — they earn from "moving meaning."**

### Economic Scenario (Illustrative)

For a partner wallet with 10M active users:

| Activity | Monthly Volume | Fee per Event | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Basic Voucher Generation | 5M | ₱3 avg | ₱15M | ₱180M |
| Advanced Features | 500K | ₱20 avg (shared) | ₱5M (50% = ₱2.5M) | ₱30M |
| Brand Campaigns | 3 major/month | ₱2M avg | ₱6M | ₱72M |
| API Licensing | 50 partners | ₱100K/year | — | ₱5M |
| **Total Incremental Revenue** | — | — | **~₱23.5M/month** | **~₱287M/year** |

*This model compounds with user growth and redemption behavior — more redemptions = more micro-revenue, without float limits.*

### The Strategic Shift

| Aspect | Current State | With Redemption Economy |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Revenue Base** | Float-dependent, volume-dependent | Event-based micro-revenue |
| **User Motivation** | Transactional utility | Emotional, participatory engagement |
| **Brand Differentiation** | Payment convenience | **Reward culture and entertainment** |
| **Scalability** | BSP-regulated | Unregulated micro-economy |
| **Competitive Edge** | Similar to competitors | **First to own "Redemption Economy"** |
| **Business Identity** | Digital wallet | **Redemption Economy Platform** |

> **Strategic Narrative**: "We're not changing the wallet's DNA — we're upgrading its metabolism."  
> With x-Change, partners earn from **every code created**, **every advanced feature used**, and **every story shared**.  
> **It's not about interest — it's about interaction.**
