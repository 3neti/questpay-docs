# Strategic Partnerships

## Overview

QuestPay™ creates transformative value for technology partners, particularly digital wallet providers. By integrating x-Change's voucher technology, partners evolve from traditional payment processors into **value orchestrators** powering the redemption economy.

### The Core Shift

> **"From payments to participation."**

| Traditional Wallet Model | Voucher Economy Model |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Money-in / Money-out | Value-in / Redemption-out |
| Earns from float, fees, merchant MDR | Earns from voucher creation, redemption velocity, and brand activations |
| Utility-driven | Emotion-driven (engagement, gifting, gamification) |
| Transactional | Social, participatory, and narrative-based |

---

## The Redemption Economy

### Consumer Shift

- 70M+ wallet users in the Philippines are seeking more *meaningful digital experiences*
