---

## **1. Executive Overview**

- *Entrepreneur’s Race:* Build and fund small ventures via micro-transactions.  
- *Good Deeds Edition:* Donate, tip, and pay it forward using wallet-based tasks.

   - Verification of official entry  
   - Gateway to the **pre-game online challenge** (used for initial screening)  
3. Participants complete a simple “warm-up” digital task (e.g., pay ₱10 donation, share campaign video, or complete wallet top-up).  
4. The system automatically tracks completion and **shortlists participants** for televised or livestreamed auditions.  

### 3.4 Selection & Announcement  
- Top participants are chosen through:
  - Automated scoring (based on verified tasks)  
  - Social engagement metrics (shares, reactions, watch time)  
  - Random draws for inclusivity and fairness  
- Selected contestants receive a **confirmation code** that activates their QuestPay™ profile for the official race.  

### 3.5 Audience Participation  
- Viewers can also register as **“side players”** — earning small rewards for predicting winners, completing brand tasks, or supporting charities via the same voucher system.  
- Expands engagement beyond the contestants to the entire viewing audience.
