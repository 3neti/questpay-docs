## About x-Change

x-Change is a programmable digital voucher system that flips traditional money transfer on its head—by letting the recipient decide where and how to redeem funds. We're building programmable, account-agnostic digital cash that's app-less for recipients, KYC/AML compliant for issuers, and secure by design.
